Title: Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
Domain: vulweb.com
Subdomain: testasp.vulnweb.com

**
**
Steps to reproduce:

Step 1: Visit http://testasp.vulnweb.com/

Step 2: On the top menu you will find a search option.

Step 3: Click on it and you will be prompted with the Search box.

Step 4: Try to find a successful payload for XSS.

Step 5: Prepare a report for it.

Impacts:
1. It helps us to detect XSS weaknesses before malicious hackers do. XSS continues to remain a major threat to such web applications. This could help hackers to steal user's personal information and exploit it.
2. A list of all the XSS payloads which can attack the website are showed in an orderly manner.
3. This can help us to prepare for future upgrades on the sub-domain.
4. It serves as an established security record for later assessments.

Mitigation: 
1. If the vulnerabilities are noticed beforehand, we can lessen the likelihood and/or impact of a vulnerability being exploited. 
2. This is sometimes necessary when a proper fix or patch isn't yet available for an identified vulnerability.
3. This option should ideally be used to buy time for an organization to eventually remediate a vulnerability. 
4. Here, Sanitize user input: Validate to catch potentially malicious user-provided input. 
5. Also we can encode output to prevent potentially malicious user-provided data from triggering automatic load-and-execute behavior by a browser
